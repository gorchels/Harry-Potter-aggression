```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in the data. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

hp_data = read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")
```

I'm in lab week 6!

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates

```{r}
hp_graph = hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge")+ #default is stacked column graph, need to give it fill = Name to get it different. position = "dodge" makes it a cluster
  theme_classic()+
  scale_fill_grey()+
  coord_flip()


hp_graph
```
